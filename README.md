# Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to teach the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a powerful approach for creating grounded and context-aware language generation systems.

What Youâ€™ll Learn:
- Understand the limitations of standalone language models and how RAG addresses them.
- Build a simple retrieval system using dense embeddings and pandas indexing.
- Integrate retrieval with text generation to create a basic RAG pipeline.
